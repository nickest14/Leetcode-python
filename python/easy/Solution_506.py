# ans = Solution().findRelativeRanks([5,8,1,2,7])

print(ans)

# Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
# Output: ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal", "4", "5"]
# Explanation: The first three athletes got the top three highest scores, so they got "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal".
# For the left two athletes, you just need to output their relative ranks according to their scores.
